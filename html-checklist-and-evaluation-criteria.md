# Global Project Deadline #1: HTML 

## Checklist & Evaluation Criteria

### Prerequisite Elements

If the HTML does not meet the following requirements, it is not ready to be tested for validation as it is incomplete. Pages that fail any of these requirements will be graded as zero.

1. Each HTML page is based on the improved HTML template (the one with the hamburger menu).
2. The top navigation has SVG and SPAN tags.
3. The footer navigation has no SVGs and no SPAN tags.
4. The footer menu has an ID of "bottom-menu".
5. Each page has a minimum of two images (figure tags).
6. The home page has three sections to be formatted as cards.

### Required Elements

These requirements do not prevent the page from being tested for validity.

1. Images have been resized to 1536px on the long edge.
2. The SVGs do not have \<style> tags inside of them.
3. Each page has an SVG **for each link** in the top navigation.
4. Every image tag has an appropriate ALT text.

### HTML Validation

- Each page must pass the HTML validation test.
- Note that some SVG code may cause the validator to display errors. These can *usually* be ignored. When pasting SVGs, make sure to **not include the XML tag** from the top of the SVG file. Errors due to the XML tag being included will be penalized.
