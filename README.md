# First Semester Global Project
 
This repository is meant as a work-in-progress guide for first semester John Abbott College web design students who must build their first web site.

## Project Objective

Build a companion web site to the print materials produced in the Page
Layout class. Use the same branding (color palette, type of imagery,
fonts, overall aesthetics) as the print project.

See [evaluation criteria](evaluation-criteria.md)
