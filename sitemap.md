(Sample site map only)

Before starting the production of the web site, take a few minutes to
sketch out the site plan. Specifically, do this:

-   List all the page names (Acme Pet Shop) and file names (index.html).
-   Write down the purpose of the page (communication strategy).
-   Plan what kind of images go on the different pages.
-   Use your InDesign document for reference.

### List Subtopics per Page

In each square of the sitemap, list a few subtopics in bullet form. For example:

- music.html
    - jazz
    - rock
    - pop
    - hip hip
